# Logistic_Regression

In this repository, we implement a few Machine Learning Algorithms for classification from scratch. We perform forward propogation and backpropgation from scrath and also using autograd.

NN from scratch is [here](https://github.com/varunjain3/Logistic_Regression/blob/7e4c5e873fe22020600fc21ceb136b2aa66317cf/nn.py).

Binnary Logistic Regression is [here](https://github.com/varunjain3/Logistic_Regression/blob/7e4c5e873fe22020600fc21ceb136b2aa66317cf/Binnary_LR.py).

K-Class Logistic Regression is [here](https://github.com/varunjain3/Logistic_Regression/blob/7e4c5e873fe22020600fc21ceb136b2aa66317cf/K_class_LR.py).

## Transfer learning on VGG-16 and implementing VGG-1

We also wrote VGG-1 from scratch using `tensorflow.keras`.
Also, trained a VGG-16 architecture using transfer learning to finetune on our [dataset](data).

This can be found [here](https://github.com/varunjain3/Logistic_Regression/blob/7e4c5e873fe22020600fc21ceb136b2aa66317cf/question7.ipynb).
